# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise see the data of different campaigns and how those campaigns compared to the campaign held for the play Fever. 
### Purpose
Throughout the project, we looked at data from over 4,000 fundraisers for various projects and compared them to each other while also finding new data such as percentage funded and average donations.  Multiple charts and tables were used to simplify the data and make the data easily consumable.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
An analysis of the data based off theater outcomes based on launch date, shows that throughout the years, fundraisers involving the theater did were most successful when launched in May, closely followed by June.  We can also gather from the data that Kickstarter that launched in October for theaters either were successful or failed but were not canceled.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
From the data based off outcomes based on goal, we can see that out of all the Kickstarterâ€™s for plays, none of them were canceled, they either failed of succeeded. We can also see that the percentage of successful plays that meet their goal is at or over 90 percent when the goal for fundraising is over $5,000.

## Results
The results of this project show that when starting a campain for the theater, the best time to launch the campaign is in May or June. The project also tells us that when setting a goal for a campaign involving a play, it should be over $5,000 so that it is more likely to be successful. To get a better understanding of the data, another possible table that could be included is a one that shows the relationship between  the lenght of time a fundrasier was held versus wether the campaign was succesful, failed, or was canceled.
